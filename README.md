# pandas-challenge
Challenge 4 on Pandas


This challenge takes data from 2 separate csv with information about schools. We will combine all of the information and create data frames in order to break down all of the information we have. 

We will check on averages in reading and math, check out their passing percentages and overall percentages.
We will compare schools, budget size, spending per student, and other ways of in order to draw a couple of conclussions.

This module is to be done using Pandas in Juypter Notebook.

Some of the concepts we need to show we have grasped are :
merging data,
creating data frames,
manipulate columns
create new data frames from the one we have
binning
mapping
using groupby

I have done my best to make note of what I did througout my code.
